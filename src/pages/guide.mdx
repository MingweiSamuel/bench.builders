# Guide

Welcome to the guide. This is WIP.

## Tools

* Sander
* Jigsaw and/or circular saw (both recommended)
* Impact driver with 9/16 in. hex socket.
* Drill with a thin drill bit (3/32 - 1/8 in.)
* Clamps
* SDS+ rotary hammer with 3/8 in. masonry bit (for anchors)

## Materials

### 2x4 Lumber

(Note that 2x4s are actually 1.5 in. by 3.5 in.)

* 6 pieces, 2x4 x 7 ft.
* 1 piece, 2x4 x 8 ft.
* 1 piece, 2x4 x 8 ft. pressure-treated

### Lumber Notes

The 6 pieces are for the slats spanning the width of the bench.
Can substitute 6x 8' pieces for an 8' bench, or 3x 8' pieces cut in half for a 4' bench.

For the slats, select straight or bowed pieces.
Bow warping is OK as it can act as an arch to counter-act the weight of people sitting on the bench.
Avoid twisted wood as it will prevent the bench from sitting flat.

Select pieces with a smooth top side to avoid extra sanding and filling.

For weather resistance, prefer Southern Yellow Pine ("SYP"), Douglas Fir ("D-FIR"), and Hemlock Fir ("HEM-FIR"), in that order, over generic whitewood ("SPF" spruce, pine, fir).
Redwood and Cedar are even more decay resistant, but 3-4x the cost.

The pressure treated piece is for the feet; look for ground-contact ("GC") pressure-treated ("PT") lumber.

### Hardware Notes

Stainless steel ("SS") is expensive overkill (unless near saltwater), so hot-dip galvanized ("HDG") is the best option.
Zinc plated (electro-galvanized) is ok but not as weather resistant.
3/8 in. hardware is conveniently standard for street furniture including anchor bolts for mounting benches on pavement, but thinner 5/16 in. bolts will also work.

Screws should be exterior-coated construction/framing screws, or deck screws.
There are a lot of brands but [GRK, Grip-Write, and SPAX are good options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eikOUFoIZ-Y).
Thicker #9 screws will also work, but overly-thick screws can cause wood to split if you don't pre-drill pilot holes.

Concrete anchors come in several forms, but basic [screw anchors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RCV4L5K/) are the simpliest to use.
Sidewalks are around 4" thick, so longer anchors may break thru the slab.
Use a longer anchor if anchoring in asphalt.

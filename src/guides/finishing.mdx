The main options for finishing are staining or painting.
Staining is easier and enhances the wood look, but painting is more durable.

For most of our benches, we use a cheap water-based semi-transparent deck stain & sealer, which may only last a year or two.
The expectation is that the benches will need to be painted-over after a couple years due to wear, dirt, and graffiti, or fully replaced due to damage.

For redwood benches, we use an oil-based semi-transparent stain, which highlights the deep red color, and is easier to reapply.

## Stain & Sealer

It is easiest to apply deck stain & sealer before assembly.
Many but not all deck stains require the wood to be dry before application.
Follow the instructions on the product for best results.

Use a brush to apply the stain in the direction of the grain to the four sides of each piece, as well as the end grain.
Brush away any excess stain to prevent drips.
Make sure there is adequate time for the stain to dry, usually 12-24 hours depending on temperature, and avoid rain.

## Prime & Paint

Painting can be done before or after assembly, altho some areas are hard to reach on an assembled bench.

Chris Duderstadt, the original bench designer recommends two coats of good primer followed by one or two coats of exterior paint.

After assembly, other art or graphics can be added on top.
An optional clear coat such as an anti-graffiti epoxy can protect graphics from vandalism.

## Sealing End Cuts

Although the leg pieces are cut from pressure-treated lumber, the cuts expose inner untreated wood to the ground, allowing moisture and pests to enter.
Treating the end cuts with a wood preservative/sealer helps prevent this.
This is especially useful if the bench is placed in dirt.

There are many products available; oil-based copper naphthenate solutions such as Copper Green or Tenino are good options.
The oil repells moisture and the copper repells fungi and pests.
The solution can be soaked into the feet and brushed onto the rest of the leg.

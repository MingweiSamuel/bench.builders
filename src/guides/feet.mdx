The feet of your bench are the most vulnerable to damage, thru rot and decay or scraping.
You can help delay these issues by shielding the feet with metal.
Fence brackets, meant for connecting 2x4s rails to posts, can be repurposed as foot guards.

## Tools

* Hammer

## Materials

<PartsTable items={[
    { qty: 4, name: "2x4 fence bracket", imgs: [{ img: fenceBracket, width: 0.75 * 400, alt: "Three-sided silver bracket with holes." }]},
    { qty: 8, name: "1-1/2 in. connector nail", imgs: [{ img: nail, width: 0.75 * 154, alt: "Short nail with a matte galvanized surface." }]},
]} />

Connector screws may also be used instead of nails, tho not on the bottom of the feet as they would protrude:

<PartsTable items={[
  { qty: 8, name: "#9 x 1-1/2 in. connector screw", imgs: [{ img: sdScrew, width: 0.75 * 168, alt: "A short silver screw with a protruding hex head." }]},
]} />

## Instructions

Rotate your bench upside down, then simply nail the brackets to each of the four feet.
Use two galvanized connector nails per bracket.

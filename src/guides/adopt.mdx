We send our benches out into the world to be loved by all.
But love can leave a mark, such as damage from frequent use, absentminded gifts of litter, or the autographs of graffiti writers.
We need your help to keep our benches clean and safe.

Adopting a bench consists of visiting it regularly, **ideally once a week**, to ensure it is safe, to buff any tags, and to pick up trash.

You (and anyone else) can report issues to us using the ["Report A Problem With This Bench" form link](/report) on the bench's page,
or by [contacting us directly](/join#join).

## Checking Safety

Ensure the bench is safe by checking for any splitting wood, loose leg anchors, or bent seat slats.
Give the bench a good shake, and sit on it to see if it is stable.
Report any issues to us.

## Buffing Graffiti

We can provide you with spray paint to buff over any tags.
Spray paint is easy to apply and dries quickly, within minutes.
Wait to ensure the paint is dry before anyone sits on it, or leave a post-it note warning of wet paint.

## Picking Up Trash

Just use gloves to pick up any solid trash around your bench to prevent it from accumulating.

If the bench is very dirty you can report it to us and we will clean and re-paint it.

## Customizing Your Bench

These benches are made by the community for the community, so feel free to adorn them with art or decorations, if you want to!

# Install A Bench

If you put your bench in public, you'll want to anchor it to the ground to ensure it is stable and
to prevent it from walking away. This guide will show you how to shield your bench's feet, add
mounting brackets, and anchor it to concrete (or soil).

## Tools

* Impact driver and drill
  * 9/16 in. nut driver/hex socket (for 3/8" inner diameter nut/bolts)
* SDS+ rotary hammer (or hammer drill) with 3/8 in. masonry bit (for installation on pavement)

## Materials

Masonry anchors come in several forms, but basic [screw anchors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RCV4L5K/) are the simpliest to use.
Brands include Tapcon, CONFAST, and Simpson Titen HD.
Concrete only needs 1.75" long anchors.
Asphalt is less solid so longer 2.5" or 3" long anchors are recommended.

Long galvanized or stainless steel lag screws may be used for anchoring in compacted soil.
Although their intended use is for wood-to-wood connections, here they can act as drillable stakes.

## Mounting Brackets

We use [L-brackets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGXTD78R) as the connection between the wooden legs and the anchoring hardware.
One side has small holes for the screws that attach to the bench, and the other side has a larger hole for the anchor.

If you want to [shield the feet of your bench](./feet), do so before attaching the brackets.

Align the bracket with the template markings on the bench's feet.
Raise the bracket slightly off the ground to allow the anchor to pull the bench down.

Use two connector screws to attach the bracket to the bench.
Avoid using holes that are too close to the edge of the wood, as they may cause the wood to split.
Do not over-tighten the screws; stop once the screw is tight against the bracket and wood.

## Concrete Anchoring

First, position the bench where you want to install it.
Ideally there should be at least 5 feet of clearance for the sidewalk.
If at a bus stop, ensure there is adequate space around the bench for the ramp to deploy.

Once positioned, hold the bench in place and use the rotary hammer to chip a small marking in the pavement where each anchor will go.
Move the bench aside and drill the holes to the depth of the anchor plus 1/2" for dust (or as recommended by the anchor manufacturer).
Then reposition the bench above the holes.

For screw anchors, simply use your impact driver to drive each anchor through the bracket and into the hole.
Do not overly tighten; stop once the anchor is securely pressing down against the bracket.

For wedge and sleeve anchors, **with a nut shielding the top of the threads** hammer the anchor through the bracket and into the hole.
Then tighten the nut to the recommended torque.

Give the bench a good shake to ensure it is secure.

## Soil Anchoring

Soil anchoring, while not ideal, is simpler than concrete anchoring.
First position the bench on firm, level ground.
Then simply use your impact driver to drive each lag screws through the bracket and into the ground.
Do not overly tighten; stop once the bench feet are securely against the ground.

Give the bench a good shake to ensure it is secure.

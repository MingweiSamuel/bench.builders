# Build A Bench

Welcome to the bench build guide!
The design is a slightly-modified version of the [Duderstadt bench](https://publicbenchproject.wordpress.com/),
which is perhaps the best, most functional bench design ever created.
It is easy to build using cheap standard materials, very comfortable to sit on, lightweight & durable, and beautiful.

This guide is intended for people with minimal woodworking knowledge, and therefore includes a lot of detail.
Read the guide before starting to get a sense of the process.

The first sections cover the tools and materials needed.
The next sections cover the preparation and assembly of slats, leg frames, and braces--these sections may be done in any order.
The final section covers finishing (staining or painting) the wood, although you may choose to finish pieces before assembly.

**This guide does NOT include woodworking safety information, so please review how to safely use your tools and work with wood before building.**

## Tools

* Templates (request via contact@bench.builders)
* Marker or pencil
* Workbench and sawhorses
* Power sander
* Jigsaw and/or circular saw (both recommended)
* Impact driver and drill
  * 9/16 in. nut driver/hex socket (for 3/8" inner diameter nut/bolts)
  * 3/8 in. drill bit
  * DrillBlock with 3/8 in. hole (optional)
  * thin drill bit (between 3/32 in. and 1/8 in.)
* Rubber mallet
* 2 bar clamps, 8 in. or larger
* Tape measure
* SDS+ rotary hammer (or hammer drill) with 3/8 in. masonry bit (for installation)

## Materials

### 2x4 Lumber

* 6 pieces, 2x4 x 7 ft. (for slats)
* 1 piece, 2x4 x 8 ft. (for seat/backrest frame)
* 1 piece, 2x4 x 8 ft. pressure-treated (for legs)

(Note that nominal 2x4s are actually 1.5 in. by 3.5 in.)

#### Lumber Selection

| --- |

</div>
The 6 pieces are for the slats spanning the length of the bench.
You can substitute 6x 8' pieces for an 8' bench, or 3x 8' pieces cut in half for a 4' bench.

For the slats, select straight or bowed pieces.
Bow warping is OK as it can act as an arch to counter-act the weight of people sitting on the bench.
Avoid twisted wood as it will prevent the bench from sitting flat.
Select pieces with a smooth top side to avoid extra sanding and filling.
Prefer kiln-dried heat-treated ("KD HT") lumber over wet "green" lumber,
as it is often smoother, less likely to warp, and easier to paint/stain.

For weather resistance, prefer Southern Yellow Pine ("SYP"), Douglas Fir ("D-FIR"), and Hemlock Fir ("HEM-FIR"), in that order, over generic whitewood ("SPF" spruce, pine, fir).
Redwood and Cedar are even more decay resistant, but 3-4x the cost.

The pressure treated piece is for the feet; look for "ground contact" lumber.
</details>

### Prep & Finish

* \~80 grit sandpaper/discs (for power sander)
* Wood filler (optional - must be waterproof, or painted over)
* Deck stain & sealer, or exterior primer and paint
* End cut sealer (optional)
* Paint brush

One gallon of product typically covers 5-6 benches (7 ft. wide) with a single coat.

<details>
<summary>
#### Prep Notes
</summary>
Sanding is necessary to remove splinters and rough edges.

Filling is optional. Most wood fillers are not waterproof (despite "exterior" marketing) and **must be painted over**.
However epoxy (Bondo or JB-Weld) and CA glue (Starbond) based fillers are waterproof.
Sander sawdust mixed with a [waterproof wood glue (Titebond III)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-g3efGa3sI&t=725s)
makes a somewhat water-resistant (tho hard-to-sand) wood filler.

#### Hardware Notes
</summary>
Hardware is commonly available in a few different materials/coatings with varying weather resistance:
* Stainless steel ("SS") is the most weather resistant, but is expensive and unncessary unless your bench is near saltwater or you want a nice brushed finish.
* **Hot-dip galvanized ("HDG") is weather resistant and relatively cheap, so it is what we recommend.**
* Zinc plated (electro-galvanized) is ok but not very weather resistant.

_Connecting together different types_ of bolts/nuts/washers is not recommended due to [galvanic corrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion).

3/8 in. hardware is conveniently standard for street furniture including anchor bolts for mounting benches on pavement, but thinner 5/16 in. bolts will also work.

Screws should be exterior-coated construction/framing screws, or deck screws.
There are a lot of brands but [GRK, Grip-Rite, and SPAX are good options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eikOUFoIZ-Y).
Thicker #9 screws will also work, but overly-thick screws can cause wood to split if you don't pre-drill pilot holes.
</details>

## Slats Preparation

The "slats" are the 6 pieces that span the length of the bench.
People will be sitting on them, so the slats especially should be smooth and free of splinters.

Sand the slats with your power sander using \~80 grit sandpaper.
Ensure the top side and adjacent edges are smooth and free of splinters.
Give the edges a small round-over (\~1/8 to 1/4 in.) for comfort and to prevent splintering.
(A router with a round-over bit is fastest, but a sander will work too).

Cavities may optionally be filled with wood filler, especially if the hole is large/sharp enough
to pose a hazard to small fingers or clothing, and sanded when cured.

<div class="caption right">
| Length | Hole Dist |
| --- | --- |
| 4-5 ft. | 6 in. |
| 6-7 ft. | 12 in. |
| 8 ft. | 18 in. |
</div>

We will need to drill pilot holes for the screws that will hold the slats to the leg frames.
The template has small pairs of holes which are 6, 12, and 18 in. from the end.
The hole distance is determined by the length of the bench, as shown in the table to the right.
Use the small (3/32 to 1/8 in.) drill bit to drill two pairs of vertical pilot holes in each end of the slats (four holes total per slat).

<div class="caption right">

| --- |
| Hole positions on the template. |

At this point the slats are complete.
You may apply your choice of finish now, or after the bench is assembled, see the [finishing section below](#finishing).

## Cutting Leg Frame Pieces

<div class="caption right">
| <Image src={legFrame} alt="Leg frame diagram with pieces labeled A, B, C, L, and S." width={160} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} class="dark-invert" /> |
| --- |
| Leg frame side view with labels. |
</div>

Each bench has two leg frames at each end of the bench (and possibly more in the middle) to support the seat and backrest slats.
Each leg frame has two legs: a long forwards leg (`L`), and a short backwards leg (`S`),
as well as a seat rest (`A`), a backrest (`B`), and a center spacer (`C`) positioned between `L` and `S`.

Trace two short `S` legs and two long `L` legs from the template onto your pressure-treated 2x4x8.
The angled foot cut of adjacent legs should touch, as shown, to ensure all pieces fit.
Each leg pieces uses three of the four template holes: the long leg uses the three holes closest to the top, and the short leg uses the three holes closest to the bottom.

<div class="caption full">
| <a href={cadCutsLegs.src}><Image src={cadCutsLegs} alt="A wide image of how to cut four leg pieces from a single 2x4x8." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |

| Four legs cut from a single 2x4x8. |
</div>

Trace two `A` seat rests, two `B` backrests, and two `C` center spacers from the template onto your other 2x4x8.
The angled back sides of the `A` pieces should touch, as shown, to ensure all pieces fit.
On the template, the `A` pieces use the two innermost holes, while the `B` pieces use the two outermost holes.

<div class="caption full">
| <a href={cadCutsRests.src}><Image src={cadCutsRests} alt="A wide image of how to cut the rests and spacers from a single 2x4x8." width={778} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /></a> |
| --- |
| Seat rests, backrests, and spacers cut from a single 2x4x8. |
</div>

Once all pieces are traced, use your 3/8 in. drill bit to drill out all the holes as marked.
A DrillBlock will help keep your holes aligned and vertical.
The `S` spacer pieces are especially small and difficult to drill after cutting, so make sure to drill the holes first.

Use your jigsaw and/or circular saw to cut out all the pieces as traced.
Make sure to look up how to safely use your tools if you are not familiar with them.
Clamp your wood to a stable surface while cutting.
The seat dent of the `A` piece is particularly tricky to cut with just a circular saw,
so you may want to start one side of the cut with your circular saw and finish the other side with your jigsaw.

At this point you should sand the sharp-cut edges of your pieces.
In particular, the front of the `A` piece, top/back of the `B` piece, and the top/back of the `L` piece are all places people may touch.

You may apply your choice of finish now, or after the bench is assembled, and you should also seal the end cuts of the leg pieces--
see the [finishing section below](#finishing).

## Leg Frame Assembly

Each leg frame is assembled from the pieces you cut earlier and connected using the 3/8 in. carriage bolts.
You will need one _long_ 5 in. carriage bolt and four _short_ 3-1/2 in. carriage bolts for each leg frame.
The pieces can be assembled in pretty much any order, but starting with the legs may be the least confusing:

<Steps steps={[
  {
    text: "Tap the long (5 in.) carriage bolt fully thru the lowest hole in the `L` long leg.",
    img: legFrameAssemblyLeft1,
    width: 200,

    alt: "The previous leg piece with a short leg opposite the long leg, separated by a small square spacer.",
  },
  {
    text: "Tap a short (3-1/2 in.) carriage bolt thru the middle hole of the `A` seat rest, then thru the top hole of the `S` short leg. Tap a second short bolt _partially_ thru the middle hole of the `L` long leg.",
    img: legFrameAssemblyLeft3,
    width: 200,
    alt: "The previous assembly with a seat piece attached askew to the top of the short leg.",
  },
  {
    text: "Use the protrusion of the second bolt to align it with the second hole of the `A` seat rest, then tap the bolt fully thru.",
    img: legFrameAssemblyLeft4,
    width: 200,
    alt: "The previous assembly with the seat piece now properly aligned, attached to both legs above the spacer.",
  },
  {
    text: "Tap a short bolt thru the bottom hole of the `B` backrest, then thru the bottom hole of the `S` short leg. Tap a second short bolt _partially_ thru the top hole of the `L` long leg.",
    img: legFrameAssemblyLeft5,
    width: 200,
    alt: "The previous assembly with a backrest piece attached askew at its bottom to the bottom of the short leg.",
  },
  {
    text: "Push the `B` backrest agains the `A` seat rest and visually confirm that the top `L` hole and top `B` hole are aligned. Tap a short bolt thru both.",
    img: legFrameAssemblyLeft6,
    width: 180,
    alt: "The final assembly with all pieces now properly aligned and attached.",
  },
]} />

The last holes may be a bit misaligned, but wood is flexible and can usually bend to accomodate.
If you cannot force the pieces into alignment, you can try loosining the other bolts to allow for more play.

| --- |
| Properly seated carriage bolt. |
</div>

One all bolts are in place, add a washer and nut to the opposite side of each bolt.
Use your impact driver with the 9/16 in. nut driver/hex socket to tighten the nuts.
Do not overtighten--watch both the washer and the carriage bolt (**on the other side**).
See the diagram to the right: the washer, and the mushroom head of the carriage bolt should be flat against the wood,
while the square neck of the carriage bolt should be fully seated in the wood.
Only a few threads should be visible above the nut.

Once the first leg frame is complete, repeat for the second leg frame **but mirrored**.

## Brace Pieces

Brace pieces connect slats together, sharing the load to preventing inividual slats from sagging or breaking.
If slats span more than ~4 ft. between leg frames, you should add braces in the middle.

## Finishing

The main options for finishing are staining or painting.
Staining is easier and enhances the wood look, but painting is more durable.

For most of our benches, we use a cheap water-based semi-transparent deck stain & sealer, which may only last a year or two.
The expectation is that the benches will need to be painted-over after a couple years due to wear, dirt, and graffiti, or fully replaced due to damage.

For redwood benches, we use an oil-based semi-transparent stain, which highlights the deep red color, and is easier to reapply.

### Stain & Sealer

It is easiest to apply deck stain & sealer before assembly.
Many but not all deck stains require the wood to be dry before application.
Follow the instructions on your product for best results.

Use a brush to apply the stain in the direction of the grain to the four sides of each piece, as well as the end grain.
Brush away any excess stain to prevent drips.
Make sure there is adequate time for the stain to dry, usually 12-24 hours depending on temperature, and avoid rain.

### Prime & Paint

Painting can be done before or after assembly, altho some areas are hard to reach on an assembled bench.

Chris Duderstadt, the original bench designer recommends two coats of good primer followed by one or two coats of exterior paint.

After assembly, other art or graphics can be added on top.
An optional clear coat such as an anti-graffiti epoxy can protect graphics from vandalism.

### Sealing End Cuts

Although the leg pieces are cut from pressure-treated lumber, the cuts expose inner untreated wood to the ground, allowing moisture and pests to enter.
Treating the end cuts with a wood preservative/sealer helps prevent this.
This is especially useful if the bench is placed in dirt.

There are many products available; oil-based copper naphthenate solutions such as Copper Green or Tenino are good options.
The oil repells moisture and the copper repells fungi and pests.
The solution can be soaked into the feet and brushed onto the rest of the leg.

{/* This step is optional, as we have yet to observe decay in our benches. - should check Gilman St */}

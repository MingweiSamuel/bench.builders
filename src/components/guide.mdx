# Build Guide

Welcome to the guide. This is WIP.

## Tools

* Templates
* Marker or pencil
* Workbench and sawhorses
* Sander
* Jigsaw and/or circular saw (both recommended)
* Impact driver and drill
  * 9/16 in. nut driver/hex socket (for 3/8" inner diameter nut/bolts)
  * 3/8 in. drill bit
  * DrillBlock with 3/8 in. hole (optional)
  * thin drill bit (between 3/32 in. and 1/8 in.)
* Rubber mallet
* 2 bar clamps, 8 in. or larger
* Tape measure
* SDS+ rotary hammer (or hammer drill) with 3/8 in. masonry bit (for installation)

## Materials

### 2x4 Lumber

* 6 pieces, 2x4 x 7 ft.
* 1 piece, 2x4 x 8 ft.
* 1 piece, 2x4 x 8 ft. pressure-treated

(Note that 2x4s are actually 1.5 in. by 3.5 in.)

### Prep & Paint

* ~80 grit sanding disc
* Wood filler (optional - must be waterproof, or painted over)
* Deck stain & sealer, or exterior primer and paint

One gallon of product typically covers 5-6 benches (7 ft. wide) with a single coat.

## Material Selection Notes

### Lumber

The 6 pieces are for the slats spanning the width of the bench.
You can substitute 6x 8' pieces for an 8' bench, or 3x 8' pieces cut in half for a 4' bench.

<div class="caption right">
| <Image src={kdHtDfir} alt="Close up of a 2x4 with stamp KD HT and D FIR, among other markings." width={200} densities={[1, 1.25, 1.5, 2]} /> |
| --- |
| A kiln-dried heat-treated Douglas fir 2x4 ("KD HT DFIR") |
</div>

For the slats, select straight or bowed pieces.
Bow warping is OK as it can act as an arch to counter-act the weight of people sitting on the bench.
Avoid twisted wood as it will prevent the bench from sitting flat.
Select pieces with a smooth top side to avoid extra sanding and filling.
Prefer kiln-dried heat-treated ("KD HT") lumber over wet "green" lumber,
as it is often smoother, less likely to warp, and easier to paint/stain.

For weather resistance, prefer Southern Yellow Pine ("SYP"), Douglas Fir ("D-FIR"), and Hemlock Fir ("HEM-FIR"), in that order, over generic whitewood ("SPF" spruce, pine, fir).
Redwood and Cedar are even more decay resistant, but 3-4x the cost.

The pressure treated piece is for the feet; look for "ground contact" lumber.

### Prep & Paint

Sanding is necessary to remove splinters and rough edges.
Filling is optional. Most wood fillers are not waterproof (despite "exterior" marketing) and must be painted over.
However epoxy (Bondo or JB-Weld) and CA glue (Starbond) based fillers are waterproof.
Sander sawdust mixed with a [waterproof wood glue (Titebond III)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-g3efGa3sI&t=725s)
makes a decently water-resistant (though hard-to-sand) wood filler.

Stain is easier to apply than paint, but will need to be reapplied every 2-3 years.

### Hardware

Stainless steel ("SS") is expensive overkill (unless near saltwater), so hot-dip galvanized ("HDG") is the best option.
Zinc plated (electro-galvanized) is ok but not as weather resistant.
3/8 in. hardware is conveniently standard for street furniture including anchor bolts for mounting benches on pavement, but thinner 5/16 in. bolts will also work.

Screws should be exterior-coated construction/framing screws, or deck screws.
There are a lot of brands but [GRK, Grip-Rite, and SPAX are good options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eikOUFoIZ-Y).
Thicker #9 screws will also work, but overly-thick screws can cause wood to split if you don't pre-drill pilot holes.

Concrete anchors come in several forms, but basic [screw anchors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RCV4L5K/) are the simpliest to use.
Tapcon, CONFAST, and Simpson Titen HD are good screw anchor brands.

Sidewalks are around 4" thick, so longer anchors may break thru the slab.
Use a longer anchor if anchoring in asphalt.
